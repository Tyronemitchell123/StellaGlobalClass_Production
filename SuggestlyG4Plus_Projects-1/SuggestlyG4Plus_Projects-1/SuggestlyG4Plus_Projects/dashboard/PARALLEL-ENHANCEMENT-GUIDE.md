## Troubleshooting

### "claude: command not found"
```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
claude auth login
```

### "Permission denied" (Linux/Mac)
```bash
chmod +x scripts/parallel-enhancement.sh
```

### Want to Run Fewer Agents?
Edit the script and comment out agents you don't need:
```bash
REM Comment out with REM in batch
REM Agent 6 can be skipped if you don't need new features
```

## Customization Options

### Run Only Specific Agents

Edit `parallel-enhancement.bat` or `.sh` and comment out agents:

```bash
# Example: Only run testing and UI agents
# Comment out agents 3, 4, 5, 6
```

### Adjust Complexity

Change `--max-turns` in the script:
- **Simple tasks**: `--max-turns 5`
- **Medium tasks**: `--max-turns 10`
- **Complex tasks**: `--max-turns 20`

### Add Your Own Agent

Copy an agent block and customize for dashboard-specific needs:
```bash
echo "🎯 Agent 7: Custom dashboard enhancement..."
start /B cmd /c "claude -p "Your custom instructions..." --permission-mode acceptEdits --max-turns 15 --output-format json > enhancement-logs/agent7-custom.json 2>&1"
```

## Safety Features

✅ **Auto-accept edits only** - Agents can't run dangerous commands
✅ **Turn limits** - Prevents runaway costs
✅ **Isolated tasks** - Each agent works independently
✅ **Logged output** - Full audit trail of all changes
✅ **Git-friendly** - Easy to review and rollback if needed

## Best Practices

1. **Always backup first** - Commit your work before running
2. **Review changes** - Don't blindly accept all changes
3. **Test thoroughly** - Run full test suite after completion
4. **Start small** - Try with 2-3 agents first
5. **Monitor costs** - Check your Claude dashboard

## What If Something Goes Wrong?

### Rollback Changes
```bash
git reset --hard HEAD
git clean -fd
```

### Stop Running Agents
**Windows:** Close the command window or press Ctrl+C
**Linux/Mac:** Press Ctrl+C in the terminal

### Review What Went Wrong
```bash
# Check the logs
type enhancement-logs\agent1-testing.json
type enhancement-logs\agent2-ui.json
```

## Next Steps After Enhancement

1. **Review all changes carefully**
   ```bash
   git diff
   ```

2. **Test everything**
   ```bash
   npm test
   npm run lint
   npm run build
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Commit the good changes**
   ```bash
   git add <files-you-want>
   git commit -m "Applied parallel enhancements to dashboard"
   ```

4. **Deploy to staging**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # Deploy to your staging environment
   ```

## FAQ

**Q: Is this safe for my dashboard?**

**Q: How much does it cost?**
A: Approximately $3-10 USD for all 6 agents with 15 turns each.

**Q: Will this break my existing dashboard?**
A: Unlikely. Agents are instructed to maintain compatibility. Always backup first and review changes.

**Q: Can I run this multiple times?**
A: Yes! Each run will build on previous work or refine existing code.

**Q: What if I only want some enhancements?**
A: Edit the script and comment out the agents you don't need.

**Q: Will it work with my WebSocket setup?**
A: Yes! Agent 5 specifically optimizes WebSocket connections while maintaining functionality.
