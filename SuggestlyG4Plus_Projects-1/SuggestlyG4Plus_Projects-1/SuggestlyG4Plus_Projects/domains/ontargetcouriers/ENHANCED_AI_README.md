# Enhanced AI Concierge System

## Overview
The OnTarget Couriers application now features an advanced AI concierge system with voice capabilities, machine learning integration, and multi-agent architecture.

## Features Implemented

### üéôÔ∏è Voice Capabilities
- **Speech-to-Text**: Real-time voice input using Web Speech API
- **Text-to-Speech**: AI responses can be spoken aloud
- **Voice Controls**: Toggle voice features on/off
- **Browser Support**: Automatic detection of speech recognition support

### ü§ñ Machine Learning Integration
- **OpenAI GPT Integration**: Intelligent responses using GPT-3.5-turbo
- **Context-Aware Conversations**: Maintains conversation history and context
- **Natural Language Processing**: Understands user intent and provides relevant responses
- **Fallback System**: Graceful degradation when API is unavailable

### üë• Multi-Agent Architecture
- **Specialized Agents**:
  - **Alex (General)**: Overall concierge coordination ü§ñ
  - **Sarah (Booking)**: Premium booking and logistics üìã
  - **Marcus (Tracking)**: Real-time package tracking üìç
  - **Emma (Support)**: Customer support and issue resolution üí¨
  - **Victor (Emergency)**: Emergency response and critical situations üö®

- **Intelligent Agent Routing**: Automatically switches agents based on user intent
- **Agent Handoff**: Seamless transitions between specialized agents

## Setup Instructions

### 1. OpenAI API Key
1. Visit [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Create a new API key
3. Add it to `.env.local`:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

### 2. Dependencies
The following packages have been installed:
- `react-speech-recognition`: Voice input capabilities
- `@types/react-speech-recognition`: TypeScript support
- `openai`: OpenAI API client

### 3. Browser Permissions
For voice features to work:
- Allow microphone access when prompted
- Use a supported browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari)

## Usage

### Voice Interaction
1. Click the microphone button to start voice input
2. Speak your message clearly
3. The system will transcribe and process your speech
4. AI responses can be spoken aloud if voice is enabled

### Agent System
- The system automatically detects your needs and routes to the appropriate agent
- You'll see agent switches in the conversation
- Each agent has specialized knowledge for their domain

### Text Chat
- Type messages normally for text-based interaction
- All features work with both voice and text input

## Technical Architecture

### Components
- `EnhancedAIConcierge.tsx`: Main concierge interface
- `ai-concierge.ts`: Type definitions and agent configurations

### Key Features
- **Real-time Speech Recognition**: Continuous listening with visual feedback
- **Intelligent Agent Detection**: Keyword and context-based agent routing
- **OpenAI Integration**: Server-side API calls for security (recommended for production)
- **Voice Synthesis**: Cross-browser text-to-speech with voice selection
- **Conversation Memory**: Maintains context throughout the session

### Security Considerations
- API keys are exposed in browser (development only)
- For production: Move OpenAI calls to server-side API routes
- Implement proper authentication and rate limiting

## Testing

### Voice Features
1. Open the AI concierge chat
2. Click the microphone button
3. Grant microphone permissions
4. Speak a message
5. Verify transcription and response

### Agent Routing
1. Ask about booking: "I need to schedule a pickup"
2. Ask about tracking: "Where is my package?"
3. Ask for help: "I have a problem with my delivery"
4. Notice agent switches in the conversation

### OpenAI Integration
1. Ensure API key is set in `.env.local`
2. Send various messages
3. Verify intelligent, context-aware responses

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- **Server-side API calls** for better security
- **Voice emotion detection** for enhanced responses
- **Multi-language support** beyond English
- **Conversation persistence** across sessions
- **Advanced agent handoff protocols**
- **Integration with booking/tracking systems**

### Performance Optimizations
- **Response caching** for common queries
- **Lazy loading** of voice features
- **Background processing** for non-critical tasks

## Troubleshooting

### Voice Not Working
- Check browser compatibility
- Ensure microphone permissions are granted
- Try refreshing the page

### OpenAI API Errors
- Verify API key is correct
- Check API quota and billing
- Ensure network connectivity

### Agent Switching Issues
- Check message content for routing keywords
- Verify agent configurations are loaded
- Review console for routing logic errors
