## ⚠️ Action Required: Restart Server

### Why Restart is Needed
The Content Security Policy (CSP) has been updated to allow inline event handlers (onclick, etc.), but the server is still running with the old configuration. A restart will apply the fix and enable all interactive features on the landing page.

### How to Restart

**Option 1: Using Terminal (Recommended)**
```bash
# 1. Stop the current server
Press Ctrl+C in the terminal running the server

# 2. Start the enhanced server
cd SuggestlyG4Plus_Projects-1
node auto-start-production-enhanced.js
```

**Option 2: Using Batch File**
```bash
# 1. Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# 2. Run the restart script
cd SuggestlyG4Plus_Projects-1
restart-server.bat
```
